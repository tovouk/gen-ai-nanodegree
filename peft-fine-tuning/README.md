# SMS Spam Detection with DistilBERT and LoRA PEFT

This project uses DistilBERT with LoRA PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam. The script leverages the `datasets` library to load and preprocess data, and `transformers` to manage model training and evaluation.
